# Flight Delay Predictor
This repository cointains Machine learning models to predict flight delays in the United States for the Mid-Term project.

## Files


- The **[submission.csv]**(https://github.com/Zmek95/Flight_Delay_Predictor/tree/master/data/Submission) file contains predictions of arrival delays for flights in the United States from January 1, 2020, to January 7, 2020. is contained in.

- The notebooks contained at the root of the project directory contain all notebooks used in the project. These notebooks mostly contain Exploratory Data analysis, Feature engineering, and model training.
- The **output** folder contains several different saved machine learning models, use pickle to load them.
- The **src** folder contains SQL and shell scripts used to load data from the database and several aggregation functions.
- The **modules** sub-folder contains many of the functions used throughout the notebooks that are present in the root project directory.
- The **data** folder contains several data samples and the weather data sqlite database.
